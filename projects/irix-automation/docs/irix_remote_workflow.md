# Deprecated: IRIX Remote Workflow

The earlier IRIX remote workflow document has been archived because it represented temporary testing instructions.

Current automation guidance lives in the architecture stack:
- `projects/irix-automation/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- `projects/irix-automation/docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- `projects/irix-automation/docs/architecture/index.md`

See `projects/irix-automation/archive/legacy-desktop-demo/irix_remote_workflow.md` for the original legacy notes if needed.
