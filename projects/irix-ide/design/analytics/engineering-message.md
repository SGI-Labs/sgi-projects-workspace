Subject: Kickoff – Remote Resilience Implementation & Analytics

Hi team,

We’re ready to move the remote resilience work into implementation. Quick summary of what you’ll need:

• Spec & mockups: front-end requirements are in `docs/front-end-spec.md` with supporting components documented at `design/component-specs/remote-resilience-components.md`. Updated mockups live under `design/mockups/`.
• Design system: token and motion guidance in `design/system/resilience-design-tokens.md`; icon requirements in `design/system/iconography-kit.md`.
• Microcopy & error handling: see `design/content/microcopy-library-resilience.md` and `design/content/error-taxonomy-resilience.md` for strings and codes.
• Analytics: event schema + funnels defined at `design/analytics/resilience-analytics-spec.md`.
• QA & Storybook checklist: `design/checklists/storybook-resilience-checklist.md`.

Next steps:
1. Frontend owners integrate tokens/components and hook up analytics events.
2. Data engineer adds events to Segment/BigQuery and sets up dashboards.
3. QA expands test plans and instrumentation based on the checklist.

Let me know if you’d like a walkthrough—happy to host a quick sync. Otherwise, please log your implementation tickets referencing `design/analytics/engineering-handoff.md` so we can track progress.

Thanks!
