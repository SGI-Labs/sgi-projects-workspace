# IRIX IDE Recovery Mockups

SVG mockups reflecting the desktop recovery flows:
- `editor-host-drop.svg` – editor with host-drop banner and disabled controls.
- `editor-offline.svg` – offline editing state with queued sync and unsynced badge.
- `deploy-confirmation.svg` – destructive confirmation sheet plus undo toast.
- `sync-conflict.svg` – conflict modal after reconnect.

## How to Use
1. Open any SVG in a browser for quick review, or import into Inkscape/Illustrator for edits.
2. Adjust copy or colors directly in the SVG (they use the same palette as `front-end-spec.md`).
3. Export PNGs for presentations via your vector tool (Inkscape → `File → Export PNG`).

These mockups pair with the component spec and checklists under `design/`.
