# IRIX IDE Recovery Flows (Inkscape)

An editable SVG you can open in Inkscape (or any vector editor) to iterate on the desktop recovery states.

## Open & Edit
1. Install Inkscape from https://inkscape.org (free, open-source).
2. Open `irix-ide-recovery-flows.svg`.
3. Each card is a grouped rectangle + text; adjust copy, colors, or duplicate cards as needed.
4. Export slices via **File → Export PNG/SVG/PDF** for presentation or handoff.

## Customization Tips
- Swap fonts to SF Pro via **Text → Text and Font** if you have it installed; fallback is Inter/sans-serif.
- Use **Layers → Add Layer** to annotate with callouts without touching the base artwork.
- The canvas is 2000×1200 px; resize via **Document Properties** if you need more space.

This SVG mirrors the flow states in `docs/front-end-spec.md` so engineering/QA have quick visual references without Figma.
