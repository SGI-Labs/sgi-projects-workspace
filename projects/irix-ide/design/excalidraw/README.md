# IRIX IDE Recovery Flows (Excalidraw)

This board captures the desktop recovery states without needing a paid design tool.

## How to Open
1. Visit https://excalidraw.com (free, browser-based).
2. Choose **File → Import** and select `irix-ide-recovery-flows.excalidraw`.
3. Pan/zoom to review the two rows of frames (editor states on top, supporting flows on bottom).

## Editing Tips
- Everything is plain rectangles and text; tweak copy or colors directly.
- Use **File → Save to…** if you want to version the board or export PNG/SVG.
- The palette aligns with the spec: stroke `#4C6EF5`, backgrounds `#1E1E1E`, text `#F2F2F7`.

Feel free to duplicate the board for alternate scenarios or annotate with callouts during reviews.
