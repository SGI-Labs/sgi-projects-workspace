<p>The following guidelines are extracted from Part I, &#8220;Integrating with the IRIX Interactive Desktop,&#8221; of this guide: </p>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id5514816"></a><a name="id69686"></a>Icon Appearance Design Guidelines</h3></div></div>
<p><span class="bold"><b>For any icon you create. . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide a meaningful, distinctive symbol that gives your product an identity and that allows users to readily identify your application and its corresponding custom data files, if any. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep your design fairly simple because desktop icons can be displayed at very small sizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that your icon can be identified across the range of viewing sizes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Color most of your icon using the <i>icon color</i> predefined by IconSmith so that your icon's state is easy to detect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use two or more areas of accent colors to help your icon stand out against user-customized background colors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid small areas of color (2-4 pixels) because they're difficult to see against patterned backgrounds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include an outline around your custom symbol, and use the <i>outline color</i> supplied by IconSmith.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid or use sparingly intense, strongly saturated colors and the specific colors used by the IRIX Interactive Desktop&#8212;bright yellow, dim yellow, royal blue, light gray-green, cadet blue, and Navajo white. These colors make it difficult to distinguish between certain icon states and to find your icon against the background colors of many desktop tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Orient your icon so that it displays a three-quarter view that faces the lower right corner of the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When designing an application icon . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Include the magic carpet, the generic executable symbol, with your application's symbol.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Indicate the state of the application (not running vs. running) by moving the magic carpet from a horizontal (not running) to vertical (running) position, or by providing two different application symbols and moving the magic carpet from a horizontal to vertical position. Remember that your application symbols should resemble a progressive animation when viewed in succession.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that your application symbols do not obscure the magic carpet in either its horizontal or vertical position.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Application icons that have two separate symbols for the not running and running states should make sure that the main part of the symbol remains in the same location during both states, so that the symbol appears stationary to the user. </p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>If your application saves data in a custom file format . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Design a unique data file format symbol that is readily associated with your application icon design and also indicates how the data is used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your application is document-based, include the generic data file symbol (stack of papers) in your design.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your data file icon does not use the generic data file symbol, create an appropriately shaped shadow for your file icon and use the predefined <i>shadow color</i> supplied by IconSmith.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id5515043"></a><a name="id34925"></a>Icon Behavior Guidelines</h3></div></div>
<p><span class="bold"><b>When creating an FTR to define your application icon's behavior . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide a CMD OPEN rule that launches the application. This allows the user to open your application either by selecting your application icon and then choosing &#8220;Open&#8221; from the corresponding Selected menu, or by double-clicking your application icon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a CMD ALTOPEN rule that opens the Launch dialog box shown in <a href="ch02.html#id39600">Figure 2-12</a> with the path to your executable displayed in the text field of this window. This allows the user to open the Launch dialog box by double-clicking your application icon while holding down the <tt>Alt</tt> key. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a CMD DROP rule that launches your application with the file specified by the dropped icon. If your application doesn't understand the type of file represented by the icon dropped on it, your application should provide an appropriate error message to the user rather than launching. This allows the user to launch your application with a specific file by dragging the file icon and dropping it on your application icon.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When creating an FTR for your file icon . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide a CMD OPEN rule that launches your application and automatically opens the file represented by the file icon. This allows the user to open a file created by your application either by selecting the file icon and then choosing &#8220;Open&#8221; from the corresponding Selected menu, or by double-clicking the file icon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a CMD PRINT rule that sends the file represented by the file icon to the specified printer. This allows the user to send your application's data files to the default printer by selecting the file icon and then choosing &#8220;Print&#8221; from the corresponding Selected menu. It also allows the user to send your application's data files to any printer by dragging the file icon and dropping it on an icon that represents the specific printer. </p>
</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id5515177"></a><a name="id96551"></a>Application Icon Accessibility Guidelines</h3></div></div>
<p><span class="bold"><b>When making your application icons accessible to users . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Place your application icon on the Applications page in the Icon Catalog. If you produce a suite of software applications, consider creating your own page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In your documentation, refer users to the appropriate page in the Icon Catalog after they've installed your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When naming your executable, use the product name or choose a name that's strongly associated with the product. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When naming your executable, use only lowercase letters. Don't use numbers, spaces, or special characters such as underlines or periods. Don't use an abbreviation of the product name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that a link to your executable (preferred method) or the executable itself resides in a directory in the user's default search path. Ideally, place a link to your executable in the <tt>/usr/sbin</tt> directory. This helps ensure that users can quickly find your application icon using the Find an Icon tool.</p>

<p><span class="bold"><b>When designing the look for your application . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the IRIX Interactive Desktop look rather than the standard IRIS IM look.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the pre-packaged color and font schemes supplied by Silicon Graphics rather than designing your own colors and fonts.</p>

</ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id5515336"></a><a name="id57728"></a>Application Window Characteristic Guidelines</h3></div></div>
<p><span class="bold"><b>In general, when deciding on the characteristics for your application windows . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Determine which category (main, co-primary, support, or dialog) each application window belongs to and assign characteristics appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When setting up your window decorations . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Include a Window menu button for all windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include resize handles only if the window contains resizable components such as work areas, scrolling lists, and text input fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include a <b>Minimize</b> button for all primary windows. Do not include this button on support windows or dialogs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include a <b>Maximize</b> button only if the window contains resizable components.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p>(To see the above window decoration requirements arranged according to window type, see <a href="ch03.html#id68452">Table 3-1</a>.)</p>
<p><span class="bold"><b>When designing the Window menus for your application windows . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Include &#8220;Restore  Alt+F5&#8221; for all primary windows. Include it for support windows and dialogs only if the menu contains a &#8220;Maximize&#8221; entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Move  Alt+F7&#8221; for all windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Size  Alt+F8&#8221; and resize handles for windows that contain resizable components such as works areas, scrolling lists, and text input fields.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Minimize  Alt+F9&#8221; and the <b>Minimize</b> button for all primary windows. Do not include the Minimize entry for support windows or dialogs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Maximize  Alt+F10&#8221; for windows that are resizable, that is, they have a &#8220;Size  Alt+F8&#8221; entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Raise  Alt+F2&#8221; for all windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Lower  Alt+F3&#8221; for all windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Close  Alt+F4&#8221; for all windows except the main primary window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include &#8220;Exit  Alt+F12&#8221; for the main primary window. Include &#8220;Exit  Alt+F12&#8221; for those co-primary windows from which users can quit the application. &#8220;Exit&#8221; always has the same behavior, that is, it quits the application, no matter how it's activated. Don't include &#8220;Exit&#8221; for support windows or dialogs.<br>
(To see the above Window menu requirements arranged according to window type, see <a href="ch03.html#id68452">Table 3-1</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always use the default behaviors for the Window menu entries except for &#8220;Exit.&#8221; Don't add functionality to these commands. When users choose &#8220;Exit,&#8221; your application must perform any necessary clean up, such as prompting the user to save unsaved changes before quitting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't add application-specific entries to this menu. Users don't expect application-specific entries in the Window menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't add a title to the Window menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use the keyboard accelerators &lt;Alt-F2&gt;, &lt;Alt-F3&gt;, &lt;Alt-F4&gt;, <br>
&lt;Alt-F5&gt;, &lt;Alt-F7&gt;, &lt;Alt-F8&gt;, &lt;Alt-F9&gt;, &lt;Alt-F10&gt;, or &lt;Alt-F12&gt; for other functions in your application. They are reserved for the <i>4Dwm</i> Window menu entries.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When specifying the label in the title bar . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>For all categories of windows, limit the length of each title bar label such that the entire label displays when the window is viewed at its default size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't include application-critical information or general status information in the title bar such as the current page number or whether a file is in view-only mode. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For main windows, first determine if your application uses document files. If it is not document-based, use the application name only. If it is document-based, use the application name followed by a colon and the filename (or Untitled if new file) in the format <i>AppName : filename</i> and update the label whenever the filename changes. Don't use the full pathname unless that information is required for users to distinguish one window from another. If your application is displaying remotely, add the host name followed by a colon at the beginning of the title bar label in the format <i>Host : AppName ...</i> .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't include full pathnames unless that information is required by users to distinguish one window from another. For remote applications, don't include domain information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For co-primary windows used in multiple document models, use the format <i>AppName : Filename</i> (or <i>AppName : </i>Untitled if a new file). For co-primary windows used in the &#8220;single document, multiple primaries<i>&#8221; </i>model, use the format <i>AppName : Function</i>. Make sure that the function matches the menu entry or the label on the button that invokes it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For support windows, use the application name and function in the format: <i>AppName : Function</i>. Make sure that the function closely matches the menu entry or the label on the button that invokes it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For dialog windows, use the application name, followed by the type of dialog in the format: <i>AppName : DialogType</i>, where <i>DialogType</i> is &#8220;Prompt,&#8221; &#8220;Error,&#8221; &#8220;Warning,&#8221; &#8220;Question,&#8221; &#8220;Information,&#8221; &#8220;Working,&#8221; or &#8220;File Selection.&#8221;</p>

</li>
<li><p>If the window is resizable, specify a maximum size such that your application window doesn't expand to fill screen space unnecessarily. If the window is not resizable, set the maximum size equal to the default size.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When supporting the Clipboard Transfer Model, don't select or highlight newly pasted data after a &#8220;Paste&#8221; operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support the Primary Transfer Model. Assert ownership of the primary selection when the user begins to make a selection. Insert data at the location of the pointer when the user clicks the middle mouse button (which isn't necessarily at the insertion cursor).</p>
</li>
<li><p>When supporting the Primary Transfer Model, don't select or highlight newly transferred data after a transfer operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use <i>persistent always selection</i> highlighting (keep the current selection highlighted even when your application loses the primary selection), unless the only action that can be performed on the selection is to copy the data using primary data transfer. In this case, use nonpersistent selection highlighting&#8212;that is, remove the selection highlight when the selection is no longer the primary selection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When supporting the Primary Transfer Model, if the current active window has a selection that isn't the primary selection, reinstate this selection as the primary selection if the user presses &lt;Alt-Insert&gt;.

</li>
<li><p>When supporting the Primary Transfer Model, when the user begins to modify a selection, such as adding elements to it, reassert ownership of the primary selection if your application does not currently own it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When supporting both Clipboard Transfer and Primary Transfer, keep the primary selection independent from the clipboard. When the user begins to make a selection in your application, assert ownership of the primary selection but do not change the ownership of the clipboard.

<p><span class="bold"><b>When designing keyboard focus and navigation for your application windows . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use explicit focus for navigating among components within a window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support at least the minimum required functionality from the keyboard, such as navigating to and entering data into editable text fields, using mnemonics and keyboard accelerators to access menu entries, and scrolling any scrollable component. Keep in mind that some users use alternate input devices that rely on having functions available from the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the window becomes active for the first time, give focus to the component that the user is most likely to want to interact with using the keyboard. When a user returns the keyboard focus to a window that was previously the active window, return the keyboard focus to where it was when the user moved the focus out of that window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put each component that requires the use of arrow keys to control it in its own field. The following components are by default put in fields of their own: editable text fields, lists, scrollbars, and sashes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use the default keyboard navigation keys for other purposes. These keys are &lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, the arrow keys, &lt;F10&gt;, &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;F10&gt;, and &lt;Ctrl&gt; in combination with a left mouse button click.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Determine if your users will need to create or modify a selection using the keyboard. If so, then support the keyboard actions defined in Section 4.1.6 of the <i>OSF/Motif Style Guide</i>. (These actions are automatically supported if you use the IRIS IM list or text components.)</p>

<p><span class="bold"><b>In general, when designing pull-down menus in a menu bar . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Be sure that users can access most of your application's functionality from the menu entries. At a minimum, make sure that the core functionality can be accessed from the menus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't include more than a 10-12 entries in a menu and make sure that all of your entries can fit on the screen at one time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide mnemonics for all menus and menu entries. In most cases, the mnemonic should be either the first character of the name or, if there's a conflict, a character that's strongly associated with and included in the name. Use standard mnemonics for standard menus and entries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limit the use of tear-off menus. Instead, use support windows for groups of controls that users might want to use continuously.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When selecting specific menus and entries for an application window . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the standard menus and menu entries as the basis for the overall design of the menu structure. Include all standard menus and entries that are applicable to your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include a Help menu as the rightmost menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include an &#8220;Undo&#8221; menu entry, particularly if users can perform actions that destroy or significantly change their dataÞ.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include an &#8220;Exit&#8221; menu entry for all main windows and for co-primary windows if users will want to completely exit the application from that co-primary window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include a &#8220;Close&#8221; menu entry for all co-primary windows and support windows that have menu bars. Don't provide a &#8220;Close&#8221; entry for main windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include menu entries that repeat the functionality of any pushbuttons on the primary window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include menu entries for actions that are accomplished using a direct manipulation method or a mouse shortcut such as double-clicking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include menu entries for accessing all primary and support windows that are children of the current window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't include entries for functions that aren't available for the current version of your application.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When naming menus . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use entire one-word titles for menus rather than abbreviations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the standard titles for menus (for example, File and Edit) if they're applicable, but change the standard title if this will make the function more clear. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use a standard menu title if you're changing the standard definition.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When naming menu entries . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the standard names for standard menu entries, but don't use a standard name for a menu entry that doesn't support the standard behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each entry name should be an action word, the value of a parameter, an attribute name, the name of a cascading menu, or the name of a co-primary, support, or dialog window. Don't use more than two words (except for task-oriented Help menu entries), and avoid using graphic labels for menus entries unless the graphics make the functionality more clear.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose descriptive names that help users learn the functionality of the application. For cascading menus, choose a name that clearly implies the contents of the menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a word if necessary to be sure the entry clearly indicates what entity will be acted upon. For example, you might use &#8220;New <i>object</i>&#8221; such as &#8220;New Folder&#8221; or &#8220;New Page&#8221; rather than just &#8220;New.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a menu entry toggles its state, use a checkbox and leave the menu entry name the same for the different states (&#8220;Italics&#8221;). If this won't be clear, toggle the name so that it indicates what action will be taken if the menu entry is selected (&#8220;Show Grid,&#8221; &#8220;Hide Grid&#8221;).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capitalize the menu entry using the same rules as capitalizing book titles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use entire words rather than abbreviations. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Display an ellipsis (...) after menu entries that bring up a dialog that requests more information from the user. Don't use ellipses if the dialog simply brings up information that the user requested (for example, a Help dialog).</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When ordering menus and menu entries . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Place the standard menus in the standard order (File, Selected, Edit, View, Tools, Options, Help), even if you have renamed any of these menus. Place any new menus between the View and Tools menus.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Group menu entries logically. If a new menu entry is related to one of the standard menu entries, place it near that standard menu entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place items in the menu first according to the order they will be used, and second according to their frequency of use (with more frequently used items closer to the top of the menu).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alphabetize entries that can be determined only when the user launches the application. If this alphabetized group appears in a menu that contains other entries, place the group at the end of a menu and use a separator between it and the preceding entries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use radio buttons for mutually exclusive menu entries, and checkboxes for a group of related menu entries, any number of which can be selected at any one time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use separators when necessary to group items&#8212;for example, to set off a group of related entries that use radio buttons or checkboxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Limit the use of cascading menus. Never use more than one level of cascading menus.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When selecting keyboard accelerators for menu entries . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use standard keyboard accelerators for standard menu entries; don't use any of the standard accelerators for your own entries, even if you're not using those standard entries. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide keyboard accelerators for the most frequently used menu entries. Don't provide accelerators for all menu entries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the key combination &lt;Ctrl&gt;<i>character</i>. Don't use the key combination &lt;Alt&gt;<i>character</i> because this conflicts with mnemonics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For pairs of menu entries where one entry reverses the results of the other entry (&#8220;Undo&#8221; and &#8220;Redo&#8221;), use &lt;Ctrl&gt;<i>character</i> for the most frequently used entry and &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Ctrl&gt;<i>character</i> for the other entry where <i>character</i> is the same for both accelerators.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Display all characters in keyboard accelerators as uppercase (for example, display &lt;Ctrl&gt;s as &#8220;Ctrl+S&#8221;). For keyboard accelerators that involve uppercase characters, show the &lt;Shift&gt; key as part of the keyboard accelerator (for example, display &lt;Ctrl&gt;S as &#8220;Shift+Ctrl+S&#8221;).</p>

</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When labeling a pushbutton . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use either a text or graphic label that describes the action associated with the button.

</li>
<li><p>If the pushbutton opens a dialog to collect more information from the user before the action represented by the pushbutton can be completed, place an ellipsis after the button label. Don't use an ellipsis if the button opens a dialog simply to display some information to the user as an end result of the operation. This use of ellipses is the same as that described for menu entries in the section <a href="ch08.html#id87916">&#8220;Naming Menu Entries in the Pull-Down Menus&#8221; in Chapter 8</a>.</p>

Instead, use multiple buttons and disable buttons that represent functionality that's currently unavailable. With multiple buttons, the functionality is obvious even if some of the buttons aren't currently active. With dynamic buttons, the user has to put the application intothe proper context to discover some of the functionality. The one exception to this guideline is the <b>Cancel</b>/<b>Close</b> button used in Dialogs with the <b>Apply</b> button.

</li>
<li><p>For single-line text fields, place the label to the left of the text field, and follow the label with a colon (:) and a space. The label should be vertically centered within the text field.</p>

<li><p>Make the text automatically scroll if the user is making a selection and the selection goes outside the range of the displayed elements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When an editable text field can't be edited in the current context but the information is still useful to the user, change it to a noneditable text field.

<p><span class="bold"><b>When using scrollbars . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use scrollbars to pan an associated view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use scrollbars with components that can be resized such that all of the available information contained in the component can't be displayed at one time. Typical scrollable components include work areas in primary windows, lists, multiple line text fields, and data display areas in primary or support windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use scrollbars with a list when the number of elements in the list doesn't fit in the viewing region (vertical scrollbar), when the elements are too wide to fit in the viewing region (horizontal scrollbar), or when the window containing the list can be resized such that either of these situations can occur. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use scrollbars with multi-line text regions when the data can't all be displayed vertically or horizontally or when the window can be resized such that this is true. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use scrollbars with single-line text fields. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use scrollbars for zooming or for rotation. Use an IRIX Interactive Desktop thumbwheel instead. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't use scrollbars to choose a value in a range; use the IRIX Interactive Desktop scale instead.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When displaying scrollbars . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Place vertical scrollbars along the right of the element being scrolled, and place horizontal scrollbars along the bottom of the element being scrolled. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep scrollbars updated. When a window using a scrollbar is first opened, the scrollbar should reflect the current area being displayed in the scrolled region.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update the data in the scrolled area continuously as the user drags the slider along the scroll region. This gives the feeling of direct, continuous control. Don't wait until the user has released the slider to update the data, because users often use the current view of the data to determine when to stop dragging the slider.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a component is being scrolled, don't scroll it beyond the first or last elements. That is, there should be no extra white space before the first element or after the last element. The exception to this rule is scrolling text elements that represent physical pages (for example, in a desktop publishing application).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make all components that use scrollbars automatically scroll when the user makes a selection that goes outside of the data currently being displayed. Also, make the component automatically scroll if the user performs an operation that moves the cursor outside of the current view (for example, if the user inserts or deletes text that moves the cursor outside of the current view). In this case, the view should be automatically scrolled so that the cursor is shown when the operation is finished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When using the &lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Page Down&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Page Up&gt;, or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Page Down&gt; key sequences to scroll a page at a time, leave one unit of overlap from the previous page to make it easier for the user to preserve the current context. This unit is application-specific; it might be a line of text, an item in a list, a row of icons, or a specfic number of pixels (for example, in a drawing region). By default, this behavior is automatic for IRIS IM list and text components.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove the slider from the scrollbar when all of the data is currently being displayed. Don't remove the scrollbar or disable it in some other fashion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow the user to cancel scroll actions by pressing &lt;Esc&gt;. By default, if the user presses the &lt;Esc&gt; key while dragging the slider along the scroll region, the scroll action is canceled, and both the data and the slider are returned to the position they had before the user initiated the scroll action. </p>

<p><span class="bold"><b>When using the IRIX Interactive Desktop scale . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use scales to allow users to change a value in a given range. Use scales in display-only mode to display values that the user can't control. For example, use a display-only scale as a percent-done indicator to show progress in a Working dialog. (See <a href="ch10.html#id17857">&#8220;Working Dialogs&#8221; in Chapter 10</a>.)</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Label it with the current value for the scale.</p>

</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When displaying scales . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Keep scales updated. When a window using a scale is first opened, the slider of the scale should show the current setting for the scale control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For sliders where the user can change the value, update the value being manipulated as the user moves the slider. It should give the impression of direct, continuous manipulation. For sliders that also manipulate an object, update the object continuously as well. For sliders that are used only to display values, the slider should be immediately updated to reflect the new value as the value changes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow the user to cancel a scale operation by pressing &lt;Esc&gt;. If the user presses the &lt;Esc&gt; key while manipulating the scale, the action should be canceled, and the scale should return to the position it had before the user initiated the action. </p>

</ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id5520596"></a><a name="id57791"></a>Label Guidelines</h3></div></div>
<p><span class="bold"><b>When using labels . . . </b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use entire words in labels rather than abbreviations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use labels for displaying text information that the user won't need to edit or select.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use labels for labeling controls as described under the individual controls in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use labels for labeling groups of controls. When used to label a group of controls, the label should be followed by a colon (:) and a space, and should be placed either to the left of the item in the upper left corner of the group or above and slightly to the left of the item in the upper left corner of the group.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use labels for simple instructions when necessary. Before adding instructions to any of your application windows, however, first try to design some alternatives that might make the instructions unnecessary. For example, if these instructions are necessary because the user interface works in a nonstandard way, redesigning the interface to be more standard is likely to make the instructions unnecessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place labels on the background of the window (that is, the part of the window that isn't recessed). </p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When displaying labels . . .</b></span> </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Don't change the text or graphic on a label. If this information will change, consider putting it in a noneditable text field instead; users don't expect label text to change.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use thumbwheels to change the values of continuous variables (that is, variables that don't have discrete values). For discrete values, consider a scale or dial instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use thumbwheels with finite ranges for zooming operations and thumbwheels with infinite range for rotating objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a thumbwheel is used to change a value that has a clear default, provide a home button. For example, a Directory View window has a thumbwheel that allows the user to set the size of the desktop icons. Pressing the home button on this thumbwheel sets the icons to their default size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use thumbwheels when screen real estate is extremely limited.</p>

</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When designing the user interface for inspection in a 3D application...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support the user model that users are manipulating a scene as though it were a single object they are holding in their hand (not the user model that users are manipulating a camera). From the user's perspective, all controls appear to manipulate the object or scene while the camera remains stationary. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Support tumbling as the default inspection function to allow users to view all sides of the scene. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Assign tumbling to dragging with the left mouse button.</p>

</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>While the user is accessing editing functions, display the edit pointer. </p>
</li>
<li><p>While the user is accessing viewing functions, display the appropriate view pointer based on the user's current viewing function (for example, the roaming pointer if the user is currently navigating a scene). </p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide a modal interface to viewing and editing whenever possible. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide an obvious mechanism for changing between the view and edit modes, such as buttons in a tool palette or entries in a pull-down menu. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Reserve the &lt;Esc&gt; key for switching between the view and edit modes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always provide a view overlay for quick access to viewing. That is, when the primary task is editing, the user can at any time temporarily enter a view mode by pressing and holding the &lt;Alt&gt; key. The user can release the &lt;Alt&gt; key to return the application to edit mode. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Reserve the &lt;Alt&gt; key for providing access to a view overlay. If the user is already in view mode, the &lt;Alt&gt; key has no effect. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Display the appropriate pointer for the current viewing function (for example, the tumble pointer or the roaming pointer) while the user is accessing a view overlay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optionally provide additional ways to access viewing, for example, offer viewing fixtures or split viewing and editing input across separate dedicated input devices. </p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When deciding between a single viewport and multiple viewports...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use a single viewport if the user doesn't need to do much editing, performance or screen real estate is critical, you need a simple user model, or if several of these conditions are met. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Support multiple viewports if the user needs two or more views of the data simultaneously (such as when editing complex objects or working on scene composition) and performance isn't a critical issue.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When designing a viewing interface for a single viewport...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the perspective view of the scene as the default view. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Update the single-viewport view with a new view as the user selects different cameras.</p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When making viewing performance design decisions...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support a minimum frame rate of 8 fps when the user is interacting with the view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ideally, support a minimum rate of 10-12 fps for editing and a minimum frame rate of 15 fps for a realistic interactive experience. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If the frame rate drops below 8 fps, provide at least one of the following solutions:</p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Automatic adaptive rendering, where the application always maintains an acceptable frame rate at the expense of scene fidelity. </p>
</li>
<li><p>User-controlled adaptive rendering, where the user explicitly chooses between adaptive rendering (acceptable frame rate but loss of detail) and fully rendering the contents of the scene (at a possibly unacceptably low frame rate). </p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If users sometimes need fully rendered, high-fidelity scenes and the frame rate is likely to drop below 8 fps, provide user-controlled adaptive rendering.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you application only provides automatic adaptive rendering, provide users ready access to fully rendered scenes. At a minimum, this should happen when the user stops interacting with the view. </p>

<p><span class="bold"><b>When designing the selection user interface for your 3D application...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Follow the object-action paradigm of direct manipulation: The user first selects an object (or group of objects), then chooses an action to perform on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For actions that apply to objects, apply the action to all the objects in the current selection and only to those objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide one current selection for each application at any time. The current selection may be empty (that is, no selection). Note that each window of your application can maintain a separate selection, but there is only one current selection. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Support direct selection as the primary selection mechanism. Using the left mouse button, the user either clicks directly on an object to select it or sweeps out an area to select multiple objects. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Support indirect selection if your users need it. For example, allow users to select an indirect representation of an object such as an item in a list, or provide a &#8220;Select All&#8221; menu item. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If your application lets users select more than one object in a hierarchy of objects, provide at a minimum a method for selecting the highest and lowest object in the hierarchy and a method for adjusting the selection up and down the hierarchy. </p>
</li>
</ul></div><p><span class="bold"><b>When deciding on a selection model...</b></span></p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If your application allows users to select only one object at a time, support the OSF/Motif single selection model as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Users directly select an object by moving the pointer over it and pressing the left mouse button. Any previously selected object is deselected. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Users deselect an object by clicking outside the selection in an empty area. </p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If your application allows users to select more than one object at a time, support the OSF/Motif discontiguous selection model as follows. Ideally, support the entire OSF/Motif discontiguous selection model. </p>
</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Users directly select an object by moving the pointer over it and pressing the left mouse button. Any previously selected objects are deselected. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Users &lt;Ctrl&gt;-click an unselected object to add it to the current selection, and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-click an already selected object to remove it from the current selection. That is, &lt;Ctrl&gt;-click toggles the selection state of the object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If users are accustomed to using the &lt;Shift&gt; key in other applications to toggle the selection state of an object, allow them to add and remove objects by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking an object in addition to &lt;Ctrl&gt;-clicking an object. In that case, &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking an object performs the same selection actions as &lt;Ctrl&gt;-clicking an object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users deselect all objects by clicking outside the selection in an empty area. In addition, a &#8220;Deselect All&#8221; menu item may be useful for some applications. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Optionally, allow users to use sweep selection to select multiple objects, allowing either rectangle-drag or lasso-drag. At the end of a sweep action, the only objects selected are those inside the sweep area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optionally allow users to &lt;Ctrl&gt;-sweep through a collection of objects to toggle the selection state of all objects inside the sweep area. That is, objects inside the sweep area that were previously selected are deselected, and objects inside the sweep area that were previously deselected are selected. The selection state of objects outside the sweep area doesn't change. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If your application supports the optional &lt;Ctrl&gt;-sweep selection action and users are accustomed to using the &lt;Shift&gt; key in their other applications to toggle the selection state of an object, allow users to use &lt;Shift&gt;-sweep in addition to &lt;Ctrl&gt;-sweep to toggle the selection state of all objects inside the sweep area.</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide clear feedback on each object as it is selected. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When using a bounding box for selection feedback, make sure that it is differently shaped or larger than the object itself so that it is readily visible. Using a distinct color for the bounding box is also highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If users don't typically select objects in your application to manipulate them (translate, rotate, scale) or can't manipulate the selected objects, use bounding boxes to indicate the selected objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If users typically select objects in your application to manipulate them, use the manipulator as selection feedback. If your application allows more than one object to be selected at a time, consider displaying the manipulator only on a lead object and bounding boxes on the other selected objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your application needs to always present a realistic &#8220;experience-oriented&#8221; representation of objects in the scene, highlight selected objects in some way rather than cluttering the scene with bounding boxes or manipulators.</p>

</li>
</ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If the user clicks to define a selection or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-clicks to add to a selection, make the lead object the last object selected.

</li>
<li><p>If the user employs a single action such as a sweep selection to select multiple objects at the same time, make the lead object the one that is closest to the camera and closest to the middle of the viewport.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the user deselects the lead object, move back through the previous lead objects making the most recent lead object that is still selected the new lead object. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user groups a collection of objects, make the group the new lead object. </p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the standard rotation manipulator either alone or in combination with the other standard manipulators.

For example, if the user is performing uniform scaling then presses the &lt;Shift&gt; key, switch to axial scaling and display the appropriate scaling feedback. Determine the single axis for stretching based on the next pointer movement. Once this axis has been determined, remove the two axes that were not selected and display the selected axis until the &lt;Shift&gt; key is released.</p>

<li><p>Allow users to perform axial scaling around a specific side of the object's bounding box as an alternative to axial scaling around the center of scaling (see <a href="ch15.html#id51446">Table 15-10</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow the user to switch between scaling around a corner or side and scaling around the center of scaling at any time during a scaling operation. For example, if the user is performing uniform scaling around the center of scaling then presses the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key, switch to scaling around the corner opposite to the selected handle.</p>
