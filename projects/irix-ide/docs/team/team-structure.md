# IRIX IDE Team Structure

## Overview
The IRIX IDE effort is currently driven by a two-person core team:

- **Mario (Product & Implementation Partner):** Provides product direction, prioritization, and hands-on development support.
- **Codex (AI Pair):** Assists with implementation, documentation, and planning tasks within the Codex CLI environment.

No additional stakeholders or designers are assigned at this stage. All design, engineering, and documentation tasks are coordinated directly between Mario and Codex.

## Collaboration Principles
- Keep communication lightweight and async-friendly—capture decisions in docs alongside the work item (stories, specs, mockup plans).
- Treat repository documentation as the shared source of truth (no external design tooling dependencies).
- When new tasks surface, log them in the relevant story’s follow-ups or architecture future-work file to maintain visibility.

## Current Focus Areas
- Complete Story 1.4 follow-ups: hi-fi mockup source files and component inventory alignment.
- Maintain design token pipeline and ensure outputs stay synchronized with mockup assets.
- Prepare for cross-validation (QA, usability) once additional stakeholders are engaged in the future.

## Next Steps
- Reinforce repository-based workflows (mockups, documentation, tokens) to keep collaboration frictionless for the two-person team.
- Schedule regular check-ins (informal notes in commit messages or docs) to track progress and surface blockers quickly.
