# IRIX IDE Hi-Fi Mockups Directory

This folder houses the repository-based high-fidelity mockup sources and exports for the IRIX IDE. Organize assets according to the structure below and keep annotations alongside the source files for asynchronous review.

## Structure
- `foundations/` – Token swatches, typography references, icon guides.
- `components/` – Reusable component masters aligned with the component inventory.
- `flows/` – Annotated user flows composed from high-fidelity frames.
- `screens/irix/` – IRIX Motif hi-fi screens.
- `overlays/` – Modals, toasts, banners, offline drawers, and other transient states.

Each directory includes a `.gitkeep` placeholder so the structure remains in version control. Replace these with actual source files (SVG/AI/etc.) as the mockups are produced. Exported SVG previews should mirror this structure and retain descriptive filenames (e.g., `screens/irix/dashboard-default.svg`).

Refer to `projects/irix-ide/docs/hifi-mockup-plan.md` for workflow details and milestone tracking.
