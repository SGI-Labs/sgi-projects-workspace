# Epic 1: IRIX IDE Foundation

## Epic Goal
Establish the core architecture, workflows, and prototypes necessary to deliver an IDE experience that connects macOS development machines with IRIX hosts.

## Epic Description
- Capture detailed requirements, user journeys, and technical constraints for the IDE.
- Define the target architecture, including client components, remote services, and synchronization strategies.
- Deliver proof-of-concept functionality covering project creation, remote file synchronization, and basic build/execute loops.

## Success Criteria
1. Architecture documentation approved (tech stack, coding standards, source tree).
2. Prototype demonstrating file edit/save from macOS to IRIX with successful remote build.
3. Backlog groomed with implementation-ready stories for IDE UI, build orchestration, and debugging support.

## Planned Stories (Draft)
1. Story: Author the IRIX IDE architecture shards (tech stack, coding standards, source tree).
2. Story: Document user personas and primary workflows in the PRD.
3. Story: Prototype remote edit/build loop (macOS editor -> IRIX compile).
4. Story: Define UI/UX blueprint for the IDE (wireframes, component hierarchy).
5. Story: Establish QA and test strategy for cross-platform workflows.

_Update this epic as discovery produces refined scope and priorities._
