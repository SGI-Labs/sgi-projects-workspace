# IRIX Integrated Development Environment (IDE) â€“ PRD (Draft)

## Vision
Deliver a modern, reliable IDE experience tailored to SGI IRIX developers, combining familiar editing workflows with seamless remote compilation, debugging, and system integration.

## Objectives
1. Simplify the developer workflow between macOS workstations and IRIX hosts.
2. Provide first-class support for MIPSPro compilation, remote debugging, and system tooling.
3. Offer extensibility for future language/tool plugins without compromising performance.

## Key Questions
- Should the primary UI run on macOS, IRIX, or both through a hybrid architecture?
- What level of offline capability is required when the IRIX host is unreachable?
- How will the IDE integrate with existing SGI toolchains and source-control systems?

_This PRD will be expanded with detailed requirements, user stories, personas, and success metrics as discovery proceeds._
