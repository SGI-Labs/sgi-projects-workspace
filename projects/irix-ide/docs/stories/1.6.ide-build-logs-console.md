# Story 1.6: Build & Logs Console MVP

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** IRIX workstation developer
**I want** a unified console that shows build queue status, streaming logs, and retry actions
**so that** I can monitor builds and react to failures without leaving the IDE

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Render build queue table with status pills, trigger source, duration, and artifacts as described in the blueprint (`docs/front-end-spec.md#build--logs-console`).
2. Stream live log output with pause/resume and reconnection banner when transport drops, matching Mockup state references.
3. Support filtering by host/build target and expose retry buttons wired to backend queue APIs.
4. Persist last selected build and restore it on IDE restart via session storage.
5. Add Cypress/Playwright (or equivalent) UI tests covering success, running, failure, and reconnect states.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement Motif widget/controller layer for the build queue, binding backend API schema to table and status pill widgets.
- [ ] Implement log streaming component leveraging existing transport abstractions with buffering and auto-scroll settings.
- [ ] Wire filter controls and retry actions to backend endpoints; document API contracts if missing.
- [ ] Store selected build metadata in session persistence layer and hydrate on launch.
- [ ] Author UI regression tests plus screenshot diffs for the four blueprint states.

## Dev Notes
- Visual guidance lives in `docs/user-guides/mockups/screens/irix/build-logs.md`.
- Backend queue expectations captured in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#remote-workflow`.
- Telemetry requirements for logs are listed in `docs/prd.md#workflow-goals`.

## Testing
- UI automation validating queue rendering, log stream reconnection, and retry invocation plus unit tests for view models.
