# Story 1.8: Debugger Session UI

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** debugging-focused engineer
**I want** a native debugger surface with breakpoints, call stack, variables, and console
**so that** I can inspect IRIX applications remotely with the same ergonomics as local debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement call stack panel, code view with active-line highlight, variable inspector, and console matching blueprint layout.
2. Support breakpoint add/remove/toggle, step controls, and display of current execution pointer synced with backend session state.
3. Handle connection drops by showing reconnect modal, retry/offline actions, and logging state transitions.
4. Expose watch expressions and value diffs, including Motif variant layout for IRIX shell.
5. Add automated tests simulating backend debugger protocol events for breakpoint hits, variable updates, and disconnects.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Integrate debugger protocol client (gdb remote) with IDE state store and event stream.
- [ ] Build code editor bindings enabling margin glyphs, inline values, and split diff toggle.
- [ ] Create variable inspector tree with search, expansion state persistence, and value diff highlight.
- [ ] Implement reconnect modal workflow and offline fallback per mockups.
- [ ] Write protocol simulator tests covering attach, pause, resume, breakpoint, and failure paths.

## Dev Notes
- UI spec references: `docs/user-guides/mockups/screens/irix/debugger-session.md`.
- Debugger transport assumptions in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#remote-workflow`.
- Accessibility/mnemonic expectations in `docs/front-end-spec.md#editor--diffing-surface`.

## Testing
- Protocol simulation tests plus manual run attaching to sample IRIX binary via gdbserver.
