# Story 1.7: Remote Host Management Screen

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** operations-focused developer
**I want** a hosts dashboard showing health telemetry, process lists, and maintenance controls
**so that** I can diagnose and recover IRIX hosts without leaving the IDE

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Display host list with status pills, role tags, and last-sync timestamps; support sorting and filtering per blueprint.
2. Render selected host detail pane with health metrics, telemetry graph, recent events, and process table.
3. Provide maintenance sidebar actions (restart daemon, collect logs, toggle offline) wired to backend commands with optimistic UI states.
4. Surface alert banner with retry countdown when host offline and log events to telemetry pipeline.
5. Include integration tests with mocked telemetry feed to validate polling cadence, retries, and UI degradation states.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement host list component with virtualized scrolling and keyboard accessibility per guidelines.
- [ ] Create telemetry graph module consuming SSE/poll responses, falling back gracefully when data unavailable.
- [ ] Integrate process table with action buttons and confirm privilege prompts/logging.
- [ ] Wire maintenance sidebar actions to backend service; add audit logging hooks.
- [ ] Write integration tests simulating healthy, degraded, and offline host responses.

## Dev Notes
- Mockups located in `docs/user-guides/mockups/screens/irix/remote-hosts.md` for style guidance.
- Backend coordination tasks tracked in `docs/team/backend-coordination.md` for telemetry cadence decisions.
- PRD workflow references: `docs/prd.md#core-workflows` (Remote Hosts coverage).

## Testing
- Integration suite with mocked telemetry endpoints plus manual run verifying accessibility and keyboard focus order.
