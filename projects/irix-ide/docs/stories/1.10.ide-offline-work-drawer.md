# Story 1.10: Offline Work Drawer & Status Strip

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer working through connectivity blips
**I want** clear offline queue surfaces that show pending edits, retries, and manual controls
**so that** I stay productive offline and understand when synced changes will resume

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement IRIX drawer and status strip variants per overlays spec with queue counts and retry controls.
2. Display queued file list with path, size, retry ETA, and allow dismissing individual entries.
3. Provide retry now, work offline, and cancel queue actions hooked to sync service APIs.
4. Emit analytics events (`offline_entered`, `retry_initiated`, `retry_success`) to telemetry pipeline.
5. Create automated tests simulating offline transitions and ensuring UI updates on queue changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Connect to sync queue events produced by Story 1.5 and map to drawer/status strip state.
- [ ] Build drawer/status strip components with a11y roles and keyboard navigation support.
- [ ] Implement actions hooking to sync API endpoints and confirm user feedback (toasts/banners).
- [ ] Wire telemetry event emissions and document payload schema.
- [ ] Add tests covering offline entry, queue growth, retry success, and cancel flows.

## Dev Notes
- Design references in `docs/user-guides/mockups/overlays/offline-work-drawer.md` and `front-end-spec.md#animation--micro-interactions`.
- Sync event contract defined by Story 1.5 deliverables (queue events).
- Telemetry follow-up tracked in `docs/team/backend-coordination.md`.

## Testing
- Automated component tests with mocked queue events plus manual offline simulation verifying visual cues.
