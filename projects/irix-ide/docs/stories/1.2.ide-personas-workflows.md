# Story 1.2: Define IRIX IDE Personas & Workflows

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product owner
**I want** clear user personas and core workflows documented in the PRD
**so that** the IDE backlog reflects real developer needs and IRIX-native journeys

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add at least two primary personas (IRIX on-box maintainer, IRIX systems engineer) to the PRD with goals, pains, and environment notes.
2. Document end-to-end workflows for project setup, remote edit/build loop, and debugging within the IRIX environment.
3. Outline key success metrics and assumptions for each workflow.
4. Record open questions or research follow-ups in `docs/architecture/future-work.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Gather stakeholder insights (existing automation experience, planned IDE traits) and summarize in Dev Notes (AC: 1-3)
- [x] Update `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md` with persona definitions including goals, frustrations, tooling context (AC: 1)
- [x] Add workflow narratives to `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md` covering project bootstrap, remote edit/build, and debugging (AC: 2)
- [x] Define success metrics/assumptions per workflow (AC: 3)
- [x] Log remaining questions in `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md` (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 delivered architecture shards outlining IRIX-native client focus, remote workflows, and plugin extensibility `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/index.md#core-documents]`.

### Component Context
- Tech stack proposes Motif client, SSH-based remote operations, and Python plugin runtime `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#client-experience]`.

### File Locations
- Personas/workflows belong in `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md`; future research additions go to `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md`.

### Testing Requirements
- PO/Stakeholder review ensuring personas/workflows align with epic goals `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/prd/epic-1-irix-ide-foundation.md#epic-description]`.

### Technical Constraints
- Workflows must reflect remote-first operation and plugin extensibility `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#remote-workflow]`.

## Dev Notes · Testing
- Manual validation: confirm PRD sections link correctly and cover personas/workflows before handoff.

## Testing
- Pending documentation review.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
James (local tools)

### Debug Log References
- `python` scripts to update PRD personas/workflows and architecture future-work entries.

### Completion Notes List
- Added detailed personas, workflows, success metrics to PRD and logged follow-up research items. Tests not run (documentation-only change).

### File List
- projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md
- projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md


## QA Results
### Review Date: 2025-09-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
PRD updates satisfy each acceptance criterion:
- AC1 → Personas added under `## Personas (Initial)`.
- AC2 → Workflows documented in `## Core Workflows`.
- AC3 → Success metrics and assumptions detailed within each workflow.
- AC4 → Follow-up questions appended to `architecture/future-work.md`.
Content is coherent and cross-references existing architecture shards.

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Documentation formatted per project conventions)
- Project Structure: ✓ (`prd.md` and `future-work.md` updated only)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Manual review appropriate)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (Criteria validated against PRD and architecture shards)

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Consider adding a third persona (e.g., plugin integrator) to cover extensibility roles.
- [ ] Expand workflows with exception paths (network drop, auth failure) for resiliency planning.
- [ ] Align success metrics with planned telemetry capture to enable measurement.

### Security Review
No security risks identified; workflows assume SSH-secured channels.

### Performance Considerations
Performance targets noted (sync/build latency); further validation planned via prototypes.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → projects/irix-ide/docs/qa/gates/1.2-ide-personas-workflows.yml
Risk profile: not generated
NFR assessment: not generated

### Recommended Status
[✓ Ready for Done]
