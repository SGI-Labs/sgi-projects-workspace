# Story 1.2: Define IRIX IDE Personas & Workflows

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** product owner
**I want** clear user personas and core workflows documented in the PRD
**so that** the IDE backlog reflects real developer needs and cross-platform journeys

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add at least two primary personas (macOS-first developer, IRIX-onbox maintainer) to the PRD with goals, pains, and environment notes.
2. Document end-to-end workflows for project setup, remote edit/build loop, and debugging, highlighting macOS ↔ IRIX steps.
3. Outline key success metrics and assumptions for each workflow.
4. Record open questions or research follow-ups in `docs/architecture/future-work.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Gather stakeholder insights (existing automation experience, planned IDE traits) and summarize in Dev Notes (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Update `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md` with persona definitions including goals, frustrations, tooling context (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add workflow narratives to `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md` covering project bootstrap, remote edit/build, and debugging (AC: 2)
- [ ] Define success metrics/assumptions per workflow (AC: 3)
- [ ] Log remaining questions in `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md` (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 delivered architecture shards outlining macOS client focus, remote workflows, and plugin extensibility `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/index.md#core-documents]`.

### Component Context
- Tech stack proposes macOS SwiftUI client, SSH-based remote operations, and plugin runtime `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#client-experience]`.

### File Locations
- Personas/workflows belong in `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md`; future research additions go to `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md`.

### Testing Requirements
- PO/Stakeholder review ensuring personas/workflows align with epic goals `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/prd/epic-1-irix-ide-foundation.md#epic-description]`.

### Technical Constraints
- Workflows must reflect remote-first operation and plugin extensibility `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#remote-workflow]`.

## Dev Notes · Testing
- Manual validation: confirm PRD sections link correctly and cover personas/workflows before handoff.

## Testing
- Pending documentation review.
