# Story 1.14: Accessibility & VoiceOver Pass

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** accessibility compliance lead
**I want** the IDE to meet WCAG 2.1 AA with full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
**so that** All developers, including those using assistive tech, can work comfortably in the IDE

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit navigation, forms, tables, and dialogs for keyboard-only access; fix focus order and visible focus indicators consistent with spec.
2. Annotate UI controls with accessibility labels, roles, and descriptions for available IRIX screen readers/status strip announcements.
3. Ensure color palettes meet contrast ratios >= 4.5:1; update tokens where necessary.
4. Implement live region announcements for state changes (sync status, build completion, offline transitions).
5. Deliver accessibility test plan covering VoiceOver walkthroughs, keyboard navigation, and contrast validation automation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Run automated accessibility scans (axe/lighthouse) on primary screens and log issues.
- [ ] Fix focus order, add skip links, and adjust component semantics per findings.
- [ ] Update token generator to enforce contrast checks and adjust palette values if required.
- [ ] Implement live region wrappers for sync/build/offline notifications.
- [ ] Document accessibility checklist and record VoiceOver walkthrough videos for QA.

## Dev Notes
- Front-end spec accessibility section: `docs/front-end-spec.md#accessibility-requirements`.
- Token contrast validation hooks from Story 1.11.
- IRIX design manuals discuss pointer shapes and hardware considerations relevant for accessible input.

## Testing
- Automated accessibility tooling plus manual screen-reader/keyboard passes recorded for QA sign-off.
