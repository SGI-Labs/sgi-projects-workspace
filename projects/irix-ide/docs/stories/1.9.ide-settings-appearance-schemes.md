# Story 1.9: Settings Appearance & Scheme Controls

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** IRIX user customizing their IDE
**I want** a settings panel to switch between Indigo Magic, High Contrast, and Motif Classic themes with previews
**so that** I can align the IDE visuals with platform conventions or personal accessibility needs

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Appearance tab with scheme radio group, density slider, and Motif restart warning per mockups.
2. Preview pane updates live when switching schemes, reflecting token-driven colors and typography.
3. Persist selected scheme across launches and propagate to active windows without reloading when possible.
4. Trigger restart-required banner and instrumentation when the Motif shell option is selected.
5. Add automated UI tests verifying scheme switching, persistence, and warning flows.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build Appearance tab component linking to shared token generator outputs.
- [ ] Integrate scheme application logic using abstract color/font names and broadcast changes to UI shells.
- [ ] Implement density slider affecting IRIX padding tokens and saving preference.
- [ ] Hook restart-warning banner into analytics and allow dismiss until restart.
- [ ] Author UI tests simulating scheme switch and verifying preview updates.

## Dev Notes
- Reference mockups `docs/user-guides/mockups/screens/irix/settings-theme.md`.
- Scheme implementation guidance in `docs/architecture/token-prototype/` and integration guide chapter 3.
- PRD references in `docs/prd.md#hi-fi-planning-artifacts`.

## Testing
- Automated UI tests for scheme toggles plus manual verification on IRIX shells for parity.
