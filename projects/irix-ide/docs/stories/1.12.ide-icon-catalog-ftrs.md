# Story 1.12: Icon Catalog & File Typing Rules

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** IRIX desktop user
**I want** consistent application and data icons registered with the desktop catalog
**so that** I can find and launch IDE tools/data quickly from the IRIX environment

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Design application and data icons following IRIX guidelines (magic carpet, drop shadow, outline).
2. Generate icon bitmaps at required resolutions and install into IRIX icon catalog with proper naming.
3. Define File Typing Rules (FTRs) enabling double-click launch, drag targets, and context menu integration.
4. Update documentation describing icon states (running vs idle) and catalog locations.
5. Provide automated lint/check script validating FTR syntax and icon asset presence.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create vector/source assets for icons, render to IRIX-compatible bitmap formats.
- [ ] Author FTR files mapping MIME/types to icons and executable paths.
- [ ] Write install script copying icons/FTRs to expected IRIX directories.
- [ ] Document icon usage in `docs/user-guides/` referencing design manuals.
- [ ] Implement validation script run in CI to ensure assets + FTRs stay in sync.

## Dev Notes
- IRIX icon guidance from imported manual `docs/007-2167-006/` Chapter 2.
- Mockups referencing icon catalog interactions in PRD front-end spec (navigation rail icons).
- IRIX toolchain expectations defined in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.

## Testing
- Lint script + manual verification on IRIX desktop showing icons, double-click launch, and drag/drop targets.
