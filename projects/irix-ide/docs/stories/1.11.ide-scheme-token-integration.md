# Story 1.11: Scheme & Token Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** design system engineer
**I want** shared token pipeline generating Motif outputs consumed by the IRIX client
**so that** I can keep the IRIX UI in sync with a single source of truth

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Promote token generator from prototype to build step producing Motif `.ad` and JSON outputs for runtime use.
2. Hook IRIX shell to generated `.ad` resources with runtime reload support.
3. Provide validation scripts checking contrast ratios and missing token entries against design spec.
4. Document token naming conventions and extension process in `docs/architecture/token-prototype/README.md`.
5. Add CI job verifying generator runs cleanly and outputs are up-to-date.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Refactor generator into installable package/CLI invoked during build.
- [ ] Integrate outputs into IRIX build pipeline and resource bundle.
- [ ] Create validation suite (contrast, completeness) and wire to CI.
- [ ] Write documentation on extending tokens, including example diffs.
- [ ] Update story references in PRD/front-end spec to highlight runtime token usage.

## Dev Notes
- Current prototype files in `docs/architecture/token-prototype/`.
- Front-end spec references to tokens: `docs/front-end-spec.md#visual-design-guidelines`.
- IRIX design guidance from imported manuals (color/scheme chapters).

## Testing
- CI job running generator + validation plus manual smoke verifying theme switch on the IRIX shell.
