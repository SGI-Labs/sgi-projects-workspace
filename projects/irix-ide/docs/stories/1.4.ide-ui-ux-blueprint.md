# Story 1.4: Define IDE UI/UX Blueprint

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product owner and UX stakeholder
**I want** a wireframe-level UI/UX blueprint for the IRIX IDE
**so that** designers and developers share a common vision for layouts, navigation, and remote workflow presentation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Produce high-level wireframes (or annotated sketches) covering the main IDE views: project explorer, editor, build/log console, and remote host management.
2. Document navigation flows and state transitions (e.g., switching projects, connecting to different IRIX hosts) using diagrams or structured descriptions.
3. Capture stylistic guidelines: macOS native look for the primary client, Motif/Indigo Magic alignment for any IRIX-native components, color palette, typography, iconography.
4. Identify UI dependencies or open questions (e.g., required reusable components, accessibility considerations, theming) and record them in `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md`.
5. Store wireframe artifacts (PNGs/links) under `projects/irix-ide/docs/user-guides/screenshots/` or an equivalent design folder and reference them in the PRD UI section.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Review architectural guidance and PRD personas/workflows to inform UI requirements (AC: 1-3)
- [x] Create wireframe assets for key IDE screens, save under `projects/irix-ide/docs/user-guides/screenshots/` (AC: 1)
- [x] Document navigation flows and state transitions in PRD or an accompanying design note (AC: 2)
- [x] Define stylistic guidelines (macOS + Motif alignment) and add them to the PRD UI/UX section (AC: 3)
- [x] Log open questions / design dependencies in `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md` (AC: 4)
- [x] Update PRD with references to wireframes and style docs (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Personas and workflows captured in `projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md` should drive layout priorities: macOS-first operator & IRIX on-box maintainer `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md#personas-initial]`.
- Remote workflows (bootstrap, edit/build loop, debugging) define the primary UI tasks `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/prd.md#core-workflows]`.
- Architecture highlights cross-platform tooling and plugin model `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#client-experience]`.
- Existing future-work items mention wireframe/mockup captures; ensure new artifacts align `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/future-work.md]`.
- Source tree indicates design assets should live under docs/user-guides or resources `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/source-tree.md]`.

## Testing
- Design review with stakeholders; confirm wireframes match documented workflows/personas.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
- GPT-5 (Codex CLI)

### Debug Log References
- n/a (documentation updates only)

### Completion Notes List
- Created and cataloged wireframe SVGs for editor, recovery, deploy, sync-conflict, and remote-host views under `docs/user-guides/screenshots/`.
- Enhanced PRD with navigation/state flow summary plus stylistic guidelines referencing design tokens and icon kit.
- Logged outstanding UX dependencies in `architecture/future-work.md` to support follow-up engineering work.
