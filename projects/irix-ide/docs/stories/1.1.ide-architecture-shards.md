# Story 1.1: Author IRIX IDE Architecture Shards

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product owner for the IRIX IDE initiative
**I want** foundational architecture documentation for the IDE project
**so that** downstream teams can design and implement the IDE with aligned technical standards

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `tech-stack.md` outlining proposed client/server components, target platforms, and key dependencies.
2. Create `coding-standards.md` describing conventions for planned languages (e.g., C++/Motif, Python orchestration) and cross-platform guidelines.
3. Create `source-tree.md` defining the project folder layout for IDE modules, shared libraries, and test suites.
4. Update `architecture/index.md` to reference the new shards and summarize decisions.
5. Document open questions and follow-up research items in `architecture/future-work.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Collect architecture requirements from stakeholders (dev, QA, UX) and capture them in story notes (AC: 1-3)
- [x] Draft `tech-stack.md` describing client/server responsibilities, target platforms, and key dependencies (AC: 1)
- [x] Draft `coding-standards.md` covering planned implementation languages (Motif/C++, Python orchestration) and cross-platform guidelines (AC: 2)
- [x] Draft `source-tree.md` outlining directory layout for IDE modules, shared libraries, and tests (AC: 3)
- [x] Update `architecture/index.md` to summarize decisions and link to the new shards (AC: 4)
- [x] Record unresolved questions and future research items in `architecture/future-work.md` (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No previous stories exist for the IRIX IDE epic; this is the first planning deliverable.

### Data Models
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
- Initial architecture scope highlights cross-platform tooling, plugin model, and remote operations as key components that must be reflected in the new shards.  `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/index.md#initial-scope]`

### File Locations
- New documents belong under `projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/` and must align with the multi-project structure already documented in the overall workspace.  `[Source: projects/irix-automation/docs/architecture/source-tree.md]`

### Testing Requirements
- Documentation deliverables should undergo PO/Architect review; no automated tests apply. `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/index.md#next-steps]`

### Technical Constraints
- Architecture decisions must consider IRIX-only delivery while retaining plugin extensibility noted in the overview. `[Source: projects/irix-ide/docs/architecture/index.md#architectural-principles]`

### Project Structure Notes
- Ensure the new shards mirror existing naming conventions (`tech-stack.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `source-tree.md`) and provide anchors for future stories to reference. `[Source: projects/irix-automation/docs/architecture/source-tree.md]`

## Dev Notes · Testing
- Manual review checklist: verify each new shard meets acceptance criteria, contains clear headings, and links correctly from `architecture/index.md`.

## Testing
- Pending documentation review.

## QA Results
### Review Date: 2025-09-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Documentation shards cover the requested scope and interlink correctly. Traceability:
- AC1 → `architecture/tech-stack.md`
- AC2 → `architecture/coding-standards.md`
- AC3 → `architecture/source-tree.md`
- AC4 → `architecture/index.md`
- AC5 → `architecture/future-work.md`

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Docs follow project style guidance)
- Project Structure: ✓ (All shards stored under `docs/architecture/`)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Manual review appropriate for documentation story)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (Every criterion validated against the new shards)

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Expand `tech-stack.md` with preliminary dependency version assumptions for planning.
- [ ] Add newline/encoding guidance to `coding-standards.md` for cross-platform file sharing.
- [ ] Identify owners and target review dates for the backlog in `future-work.md` during next planning cycle.

### Security Review
No security issues noted; remote workflow relies on SSH transports.

### Performance Considerations
No performance concerns at this documentation stage.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → projects/irix-ide/docs/qa/gates/1.1-ide-architecture-shards.yml
Risk profile: not generated
NFR assessment: not generated

### Recommended Status
[✓ Ready for Done]
