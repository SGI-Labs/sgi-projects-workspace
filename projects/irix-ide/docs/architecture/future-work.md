# Architecture Future Work

Document open questions, research spikes, and pending decisions uncovered while preparing the IRIX IDE architecture.

## Pending Topics (Initial)
- Evaluate UI framework options (Motif vs. custom toolkit vs. remote macOS UI).
- Determine build orchestration strategy (local vs. remote compilation, containerization on IRIX).
- Assess debugging experience requirements (remote gdb integration, graphical debugger support).
- Identify plugin system approach for extensibility.

_Update this list as discovery progresses._

- Evaluate feasibility of embedding Motif UI elements inside the macOS client via remote visualization.
- Prototype remote debugging workflow using gdbserver on IRIX with a macOS front-end.
